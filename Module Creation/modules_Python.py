# How to create a Modules on our own (Creation of Modules)
# To create a module,
# all you need to do is create a py file in a similar path to your python file.
# Inside that file, you can add required functions you need your program to perform.

# To call the module inside your program, a
# ll you need to do is use import keyword followed by the name of your py file.
